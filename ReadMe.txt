Setup:
- running a local server for loading local images:(https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)
- windows make public (https://www.simonewebdesign.it/how-to-put-online-your-wampserver/)

Orginization:
- Laws:
-- Base are those that are stable and function as expected
-- Experimental are those that might be fun or have some bugs to still work out
-- old are those that where determined to not be fun but we might find a way to make them fun in the future

-Assets: assets.js is responsible for loading all the assets into a format p5 can handle
-- Characters are portraits
-- Icons are icons
